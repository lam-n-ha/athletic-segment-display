# athletic-segment-display
athletic-segment-display: ECE 387 Final Individual Project Introduction This project is a segment display made from a combination of many servo motors. The inspiration for this project is the many servo-powered seven segment display projects on the internet. I wanted to adapt this and create a toy where a human figure is represented by a segment display, with the position of their limbs controlled by the segments themselves. The idea is a toy where the user will copy the poses done by the figure made by the display, which will then change its orientation at controllable frequencies Components The project will consist of an Arduino Uno and several servo motors, along with materials to mount the servo motors on and materials to be attached to the motors to act as the segments themselves
